The object appeared to be moving from south to west approximately 15 degrees above the horizon.  There were seven white lights equallly spaced around the object. It appeared to be banking slightly as I could easily see a bright red pulsating light in the middle of the underside of the object.  It disappeared behind many large douglas fir trees and was not seen again.  The red light appeared to pulsate at one second intervals.  The apparent size of the object in my field of view was approximately one inch in diameter.

Object was just above tree top level and seemed to undulate (kind of like jello) with the white and then the red light dominating in color.  The object was in a downward trajectory as though it would enter Lake Washington if it continued it's downward movement.  There was no sound that I could discern from the object even though I was inside.  We can usually hear an aircraft even from indoors here in our area. 
 
The light was far brighter than any aircraft lights or helicopter lights, and was much larger. It also did not follow the usual aircraft flight patterns that are the norm for this area.

As I was driving Northward towards Lake Sammamish, I saw 4 crafts with red and white lights hovering over Lake Sammamish.  For a long time they did not move at all.  I thought they must be helicopters but I hav never seen helicopters with lights like that.  There were about 3 red lights in a row and a white light that flashed.  I cannot account for them other than to think they were UFOS.

We seen a red light just like the one on your home page, except we seen something white and small deploy from the red object and then dissappear seconds later.  It started in the Northwest and moved towards the North. 
 
Then the mysterious red circle dissappeared when we all turned our head just for a split second.
